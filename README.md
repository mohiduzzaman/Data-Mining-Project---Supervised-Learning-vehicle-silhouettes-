# Data-Mining-Project---Supervised-Learning-vehicle-silhouettes-

The reason of this project is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle using a set of attributes extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle might be seen from one of a wide range of edges. The first design was to discover a strategy for recognizing 3D questions inside a 2D picture by use of an outfit of shape highlight extractors to the 2D outlines of the articles. Proportions of shape highlights extricated from model outlines of articles to be separated were utilized to produce a grouping rule tree by methods for PC acceptance. This item acknowledgment procedure was effectively used to separate between outlines of model cars, vans and buses saw from compelled rise yet all points of turn. The principle center is to locate the best classifier utilizing WEKA for the given informational index.

Analysis the Result:
Analyzing all 8 different algorithms for the given specification and data set was tested, it has been seen that Jrip is the best classifier for this dataset. According to analysis Jrip has the highest correctly Classified Instances Correctly Classified Instances is 614 which is = 72.5768 % and Incorrectly Classified Instances is 232 which is 27.4232 %.
Now 2nd nearest best algorithm Correctly Classified Instances for Kstar is 604 which is 71.3948 % and Incorrectly Classified Instances=242 which is 28.6052 %.
Now 3rd nearest best algorithm Correctly Classified Instances for Random Tree is 602 which is 71.1584 % and Incorrectly Classified Instances=244 which is 28.8416 %.
ZeroR and NaiveBayes classifiers are worst for this dataset. ZeroR correctly classified only 217 instance and Na√ØveBayes only 379 instances.
So, any of these three classifier (Jrip, Kstar, Random Tree) can be chosen as the best classifier because other of the five classifiers points are comparatively away from best point.
So, for this dataset Jrip is the best classifier.
